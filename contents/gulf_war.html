<p><P>Saddam Hussein, as Kuwaitis to their horror learned overnight, is not a man
to be trifled with.
Lionised at home, the 53-year-old President has long been viewed with more

his rebellious Kurds, and he is reliably reported to have drawn his pistol
and shot dead a minister who dared openly to question his strategy.</P>
